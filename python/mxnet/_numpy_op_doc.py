    Repeat elements of an array.
    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    repeats : int or array of ints
        The number of repetitions for each element.  `repeats` is broadcasted
        to fit the shape of the given axis.
    axis : int, optional
        The axis along which to repeat values.  By default, use the
        flattened input array, and return a flat output array.
    Returns
    -------
    repeated_array : ndarray
        Output array which has the same shape as `a`, except along
        the given axis.

    --------
    tile : Tile an array.
    Examples
    --------
    >>> x = np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])

    ----------
    a : array_like
        The shape and data-type of `a` define these same attributes of
        the returned array.
    dtype : data-type, optional

        .. versionadded:: 1.6.0
    order : {'C', 'F', 'A', or 'K'}, optional

        'F' means F-order, 'A' means 'F' if `a` is Fortran contiguous,

    subok : bool, optional.
        If True, then the newly created array will use the sub-class

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : ndarray
        Array to be reshaped.
    newshape : int or tuple of ints
        The new shape should be compatible with the original shape. If
        an integer, then the result will be a 1-D array of that length.
        One shape dimension can be -1. In this case, the value is
        inferred from the length of the array and remaining dimensions.
    order : {'C'}, optional
        Read the elements of `a` using this index order, and place the
        elements into the reshaped array using this index order.  'C'
        means to read / write the elements using C-like index order,
        with the last axis index changing fastest, back to the first
        axis index changing slowest. Other order types such as 'F'/'A'

    The multinomial distribution is a multivariate generalisation of the binomial distribution.
    Take an experiment with one of ``p`` possible outcomes. An example of such an experiment is throwing a dice,

    Its values, ``X_i = [X_0, X_1, ..., X_p]``, represent the number of times the outcome was ``i``.


    Parameters
    ----------
    n : int
        Number of experiments.
    pvals : sequence of floats, length p
        Probabilities of each of the p different outcomes. These should sum to 1
        (however, the last element is always assumed to account for the remaining
        probability, as long as ``sum(pvals[:-1]) <= 1)``.
    size : int or tuple of ints, optional
        Output shape. If the given shape is, e.g., ``(m, n, k)``, then ``m * n * k`` sam-

    a : array_like

    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the cumulative sum is computed. The default

    dtype : dtype, optional
        Type of the returned array and of the accumulator in which the
        elements are summed.  If `dtype` is not specified, it defaults
        to the dtype of `a`, unless `a` has an integer dtype with a
